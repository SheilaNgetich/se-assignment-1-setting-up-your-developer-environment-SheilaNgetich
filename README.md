-After installation, open a command prompt or terminal to configure Git with your username and email using git config --global user.name "Your Name" and git config --global user.email "your@email.com". -Create a GitHub account at github.com if you haven't already. Once logged in, click on the "+" sign at the top right of the page, select "New repository," and name it with an optional description. 
-Choose whether it should be public or private, then click "Create repository." To push your code to this repository, initialize a Git repository locally with git init, add your files with git add ., commit them using git commit -m "Initial commit", add the remote repository URL with git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git, 
-Finally push your changes to GitHub with git push -u origin master, entering your GitHub credentials if prompted. This process establishes Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting, facilitating collaboration and code management. 
-Adjust commands as necessary for SSH authentication or repository specifics.

## Step 4: Install Python
-To install Python, visit the official Python website at python.org and download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). 
-Run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file and follow the prompts to customize your installation. Make sure to select the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation for easier command line access.

-Optionally, check if pip, Python's package manager, is installed by typing pip --version and install it if necessary following Python's documentation. With Python installed and verified, you can start coding in Python for various applications like scripting, web development, and data analysis by launching the Python interpreter with the python command in your terminal or command prompt.

-To install MySQL database on your system, begin by visiting the MySQL download page at dev.mysql.com/downloads. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download it. 
-Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. During installation, select the "Custom" option to customize the installation type. 
-Choose components such as MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench. Set the installation directory and configure options like the default storage engine (e.g., InnoDB). 
-Create a root password when prompted, which you'll use to access MySQL. Complete the installation process and launch MySQL Workbench or use the command line to verify the installation. 
-Connect to MySQL, create databases, and manage users as needed for your projects. Adjust configurations based on specific requirements or system preferences to ensure MySQL is properly installed and configured for your development environment.
